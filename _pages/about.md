I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. [Bruce Hajek](https://hajek.ece.illinois.edu/). 


My research deals with inference, optimization, and decision-making in stochastic networks and matching systems. My PhD work is on problems in **statistical inference** (graph matching and detection of planted structures), **resource allocation in matching markets** (spatial flexibility and multi-type interactions), and **network robustness** (graph matching under adversarial corruption, security of blockchain protocols under message loss). My work has been recognized through multiple departmental fellowships and paper awards, including the [Jack Wolf ISIT Best Student Paper Award (2025)](https://www.itsoc.org/news/2025-jack-keil-wolf-isit-student-paper-award-recipients-named); I was also a finalist for the [IISA Best Student Paper Award (2025)](https://www.intindstat.org/public/conference2025/images/pgrmbook.pdf#page=52.64), and the [INFORMS APS Best Student Paper Award (2024)](https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/Community-Prizes/Applied-Probability/Best-Student-Paper-Prize).

I graduated with B.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics from the [American University of Sharjah](https://www.aus.edu), where I received the President's cup for highest GPA. My research there focused on problems in control theory and communication networks. I also worked on the **Ising model** during a research internship at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en), Finland.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading, traveling and hiking. I particularly appreciate the US National Parks and aspire to eventually explore all 63!

**I am on the 2025-26 academic job market.**
