I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. [Bruce Hajek](https://hajek.ece.illinois.edu/). 

My doctoral research involves developing and analyzing algorithms for large-scale random systems, focusing on statistical inference, performance evaluation and information recovery from network data. Specific topics include **graph alignment**, **correlation detection**, and **security of distributed protocols in blockchains**. I've also explored optimizing **resource allocation** in wireless networks during an internship at [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.nokia.com/bell-labs/). My broader interests include **dynamic matching** and **robust decision-making** in networked environments.

I graduated with B.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics from the [American University of Sharjah](https://www.aus.edu), where I received the President's cup for highest GPA. My research there focused on problems in **control theory, communication networks, and microwave sensing**. I also worked on the **Ising model** during a research internship at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en), Finland.

Outside of work, I enjoy reading, traveling and hiking. I particularly appreciate the US National Parks and aspire to eventually explore all 63!
